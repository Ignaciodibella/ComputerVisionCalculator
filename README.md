### How to use it:
1. Download the code.
2. See the **Requirement** section for installation requirements.
3. Once it's up and running you'll notice the front camera will open up and a window will pop up.
4. Your index finger will serve as a mouse. Also, al line will be "connecting" your index and your middle finger. <br>
   If you put both fingers together you'll be simulating a click event.<br>
   **The closer to the screen you are, the greater click sensitivity and the further away, the greater sensitivity.**
5. There are two special keys in the calculator keyboard:
  <br>**D:** It is used to delete the last number or operator entered,
  <br>**C:** It is used to clear the calculator screen.
6. To keep in mind:
   <br> The 2**3 input will work as a power operator, so the result will be 8.
   <br> Two minus signs will end up being interpreted as a sum and a (5 - - 5 = 10)
   <br> And something similar happens if you mix +/- endig up in a substraciont (5 +- 2 = 3)
